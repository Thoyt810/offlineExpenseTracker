# offlineExpenseTracker

For the user, we want them to be able to track and have what they need at their fingertips to track their spending habbits.

WHEN he page load they are offered to fields to which they can name and give an amount to their total.

THEN by clicking the add/subtract funds, the graph will update with the proper amount to see where they are with their expenses.

The goal is to actuvely track and store this while the user is offline as well
